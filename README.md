# acceleration_structure_demo
Basic demo of an acceleration structure used for rendering thousands of entities

This Demo shows the impact of acceleration structures for rendering / updating large amount of entities.

Up to 10 000 000 of rectangles are drawn inside the camera view.

The na√Øve method is testing for each rectangle if the rectangle is inside the camera view before drawing it to the screen

The other method is using a basic quad tree as an acceleration structure which helps reducing the number of tests done on each rectagles per frames

## Requirements
This demo is meant to be executed with [Love2d](https://love2d.org/) a Lua game framework

## Controls

- Move by dragging the mouse with the left click
- Zoom using the scroll wheel
- Press B to switch activate / deactivate the usage of acceleration structure
